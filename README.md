## Summary

The goal of this project is to create a Cityscape procedural generator in Unity3D. I plan to include areas of high rise and some areas of low rise buildings that limit the generation to specific size buildings, This is to create a sort of urban-flow rather than a completely random cluster of buildings. I also plan to include streets and park/grassy areas.

## Background

The main reason I decided to do procedural city generation as my project is I am very interested in procedural generation in game design. The Idea of an infinite or near infinite open world game is very appealing to me. I really enjoy games like No Man's Sky and am very interested in creating an open world RPG game in the near future, hopefully implementing a number of procedurally generated structures, cities, characters and personalities in order to prolong playability. This project would be a nice first step towards that kind of future project.

## Proposed Approach

- [x] Research Procedural Generation Using Perlin Noise.
- [x] Implement an initial generation of basic shapes using Perlin Noise.
- [x] Diversify the generation into clusters of different shapes by manipulating the Perlin Noise.
- [x] Add a character to explore the generations.
- [x] Add park/grassy areas to the generations.
- [x] Add roads/streets to the generations which will punctuate the buildings and parks.
- [x] Create models for buildings, roads, etc. to replace placeholder objects.
- [x] Attempt to add details to the sidewalks, e.g. benches.
- [x] Increase the complexity of generations through the introduction of my own personal algorithms/functions.
- [ ] Add to the detail of city by adding characters/vehicles that traverse the city/streets.

I'm usually not a huge fan of sifting through documentation but the Unity documentation has already proved invaluable and has been very easy to navigate and find what I need.
